      Good morning, everyone my name is Vibhore Sagar or you can call me Vib

      With technology booming, the race for space travel becoming competitive,
      and the ever-ambitious Elon Musk plotting to turn Mars into the next
      luxury vacation spot, have you ever wondered what tools and skills you'd
      need to survive on the planet Mars with the technology present today?
    </li>
    <li>
      So today I will be providing a rough field guide to survive on Mars.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some general things about Mars, its the 4th planet in our solar system,
      its right on the outer boundary of our solar systems habitable zone and
      the planet has similar features just like our own Earth. Well first, lets
      introduce the planet and a little bit about its history.

    Well first, lets introduce the planet and a little bit about its history.
  </h7>

    <li>Main Point 1</li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mars has a similar age to out planet around 4.5 billion years old. Since
        being the closest planet to us, it has been observed for around 4000
        years, but the first observations done through a telescope was done by
        Galileo
      </li>
      <li>
        You must be wondering that if mars is similar in structure and age to
        our home planet, why isn't there any life discovered there? Its because
        almost 4 Billion years ago, Mars' core cooled down which made its
        magnetic fields weak and let the solar rays wash away most of its
        atmosphere. And now its atmosphere is about 96% Carbon dioxide.

    >So now you must be wondering, how could we survive space when there is no
    oxygen for humans to live there and this is where Im going to talk about how
    far technology has come</h7
  >
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Main Point 2</li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        As everyone knows, humans have been to space and even to the Moon! and
        humans have lived in space in the International Space Station for many
        days and a few have lived on there for over a year!
      </li>
      <li>
        Going to space is tricky and takes a lot of mathematics and science and
        the right conditions but its certainly not impossible anymore. Nasa has
        worked out a solution for almost every problem that might occur for
        living in space.
      </li>
      <li>
        The basic substances that are required by humans to survive are Oxygen,
        Water and food, and space has a scarcity for all 3 of these. But we can
        get oxygen through the oxygen tanks, food on the space station is
        packaged in non-perishable containers, there is oven on board that is
        used for heating and cooking. But how do astronauts drink water in
        space? Do they take it with them on the rockets? The astronauts in space
        recycle every drop of water they can, from their sweat through
        condensation and even their own urine is recycled that it’s safe to
        drink and be consumed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Main Point 3</li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The first thing we would need to do is get to mars, which many people
        are already working on how to transport humans to mars, and throughout
        the years Nasa has sent many robots and rovers to mars to find more
        about our neighboring planet. So we can send equipment already using
        rovers and robots before astronauts even leave for mars.
      </li>
      <li>
        After we reach Mars, we need to build and construct Bio-domes that can
        sustain an oxygen rich atmosphere.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the basic bio-dome is set up, we can start setting up essential
        systems for the bio-dome. Mars’ gravity is 38% of Earth’s gravity so
        there will be a time period for getting used to the planet and its
        atmosphere, seasons, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        We would need a source for food and since we can’t grow food there like
        on earth, we would need to figure out creative and smart ways to source
        food.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the start, we could plan short missions, a few months or a year
        maximum but as technology grows, we will be able to find solutions to
        new problems that arise.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
  <ol>
    <li>
      So today, I told you about how to survive on Mars and how our current
      technology has advanced that has made it possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      I hope this speech was helpful incase in the future we do get an
      opportunity to visit mars.
    </li>
    <li>Thank you</li>
